title: A quadrapedal remote-controlled robot-dog
tags: robotics
---

This is a build log for the [Stanford Pupper](https://stanfordstudentrobotics.org/pupper), an open-sourced quadrupedal
robot. Perhaps it would also make a sufficiently good pet dog. Once built, I hope to hook up a camera, and allow it to 
be controlled from a web UI.

See below for a brief introduction:
